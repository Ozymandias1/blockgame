# blockgame

this project is typical block placement game development project using godot engine.

i focused on functional implementation, and since I'm learning godot engines, gdscript or implementation may not be professional.

so i hope you understand if there is anything wrong with the project, and i hope this project helps someone this project even though it's not good enough.

best regards.
